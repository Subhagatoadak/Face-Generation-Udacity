# Face-Generation-Udacity
This repo contains codes to generate faces using DCGAN.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. My goal was to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

### Get the Data
I have used the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) to train my adversarial networks.

This dataset is more complex than the number datasets (like MNIST or SVHN), so, I have should defined deeper networks and trained them for a longer time to get good results.
